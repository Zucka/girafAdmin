\chapter{Problem Statement}
\label{chap:problemStatment}
The general purpose for this project has been explained both in this reports introduction and in the GIRAF introduction, see \ref{chap:introduction} and \ref{sec:admin}.

The first GIRAF Admin project was started in 2011, then in 2012 it was split into two projects, called Savannah and Oasis. The two last named projects were focused on constructing database systems as well as user interfaces to support it. Savannah was implemented as a web version and Oasis as a tablet version. When the two projects were finished, the databases could not synchronise and was at this project's start ultimately scrapped due to incompatibility and low maintainability.\\
In 2013 the projects were split into constructing an administration interface and constructing a proper synchronisable database. The database project this year was named Wasteland \citep{wasteland}.\\

Since Wasteland chose to redesign the database in order to accommodate the use on several platforms and synchronisation, it was a logical choice to also redesign the administration interface, seeing that a database design would render previous projects work useless. This also accommodated a way to heighten maintainability and user friendliness. This will hopefully ensure that this administration system will not be discarded next year.\\
In order to fulfil the general need of user creation in the GIRAF system, the focus will have to be on creating all the profile management tools first. This means that if some of the features cannot be implemented in time, as explained in \vref{chap:systemOverview}, then the focus should be on the user management interface. This will leave all management of pictograms to the tablet projects.

This has lead to the following problem statement:
\begin{verse}
\textit{``Currently there are two different administration interfaces for the GIRAF system.
This results in a problem with maintainability and user friendliness.
How can we make a \underline{single} user friendly administration interface for the GIRAF system?''}
\end{verse}
