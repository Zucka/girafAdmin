\chapter{Problem Statement}
The general purpose for this project has been explained both in this reports introduction and in the GIRAF introduction, see \ref{chap:introduction} and \ref{sec:admin}.

The first GIRAF Admin project was started in 2011, then in 2012 it was split into two projects, called Savanah and Oasis. These two last named projects was focused on constructing Database systems as well as user interfaces to use these. Savanah was focused on an internet version and Oasis on a tablet version. When these two projects was finished, the databases could not communicate and had no chance to do so, because of different database schemes.\\
Now in 2013 we have split the assignments into constructing an Admin interface and constructing a proper synchronizable database. The database project this year is called WASTELAND \citep{wasteland}.


The problem statement:
\begin{verse}
\textit{''Currently there are two different administration interfaces for the GIRAF system.
This results in a problem with maintainability and user friendliness.
How can we make a single user friendly administration interface for the GIRAF system?''}
