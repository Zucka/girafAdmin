This report documents the development of an administration system for the GIRAF system as of Software 6 multiproject 2013. The administration system is designed for high maintainability and user friendliness. The back-end for the system is written entirely in PHP, the front-end is a combination of HTML, JavaScript and CSS. The administration system should enable users to administrate users, applications and pictograms. However the pictogram and application systems are not fully implemented. To administrate pictograms refer to the Parrot project under the GIRAF system. Mockups of the complete system is viewable in the appendix.
