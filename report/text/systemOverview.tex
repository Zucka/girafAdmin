\chapter{System Overview}
\label{chap:systemOverview}
%What will this chapter contain
In this chapter we give an overview of the features that the system contains, their status and why they are necessary.

Below is shown a table containing each feature that we have designed. As can be seen by table \ref{tab:FeatureTable} we have designed a few features that we think is necessary for the online PC system. It can also be seen that we only managed to finish 3 out of 12 features and 4 out of 12 is only in need of DB implementation. That leaves 5 out of 12 features unstarted, where 4 of these are related to the Pics Manager.

%Tabel of System functions, with completion status
\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
		\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

		\end{tabular}
	\caption{Feature Table - The status explain if they have been finished or not}
	\label{tab:FeatureTable}
\end{table}

As it can also be seen from the table we have focused on implementing features that makes it possible to handle Profile related issues. This have been done because it is already possible to handle pictograms from the tablet systems.\\
We did implement one of the Pics Manager features, Make, this is due to it not being system wise directly connect to the remaining 4. The 4 remaining features of the Pics Manager are all based on the same search and select system and should therefore not prove difficult to implement at a later point. But more on this later, see chapter \vref{chap:futureWork}.

This chapter should now have given a proper overview of the systems features, and it should be clear what the system is intended for and how. The next chapter will explain how we designed the system, followed by a deeper explanation of some of the more advanced features in the system.
