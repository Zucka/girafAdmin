\chapter{System Overview}
\label{chap:systemOverview}
%What will this chapter contain
In this chapter we give an overview of the features which the system contains, their status and why they are necessary.

Below is shown a table containing each feature which we have designed. As can be seen in table \ref{tab:FeatureTable} we have designed a few features which we think is necessary for the online PC system. It can also be seen that we only managed to finish 3 out of 13 features and 5 out of 13 are only in need of DB implementation. That leaves 5 out of 13 features unstarted, where 4 of these are related to the Pics Manager.

%Tabel of System functions, with completion status
\begin{table}[htbp]

		\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

		\end{tabular}
	\caption{Feature Table - The status explains if they have been finished or not}
	\label{tab:FeatureTable}
\end{table}

As it also can be seen in the table we have focused on implementing features which makes it possible to handle Profile related issues. This have been done because it is already possible to handle pictograms from the tablet systems.\\
We did implement one of the Pics Manager features, Make, this is due to it not being system wise directly connect to the remaining 4. The 4 remaining features of the Pics Manager are all based on the same search and select system and should therefore not prove difficult to implement at a later point. More can be read about this in chapter \vref{chap:futureWork}.
