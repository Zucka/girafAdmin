This project is a part of the multi-project called GIRAF, which stands for: ``Graphical Interface Resources for Autistic Folk'' which have been an active project at Aalborg University since 2011.\\
As the name suggests this system is a tool made for helping children with autism to communicate. The system is to be actively used in the specialized kindergardens and schools in Aalborg.\\
This report contains first an introduction to the GIRAF project, which describes the GIRAF project as it is as of the day this report was written. This introduction is contained in all project reports for the GIRAF multi-project, and can therefore be skipped if the reader is already familiar with the GIRAF project as of May 2013. The place to be skipped to is then part \vref{skipToMe}.\\
The second part of this report also contains the thoughts that went into constructing the new administration system, as well as some in depth explanation of the implementations, for the GIRAF system.\\
The administration system makes it possible to edit and create users for the GIRAF system and in its finished state it is possible to administrate both from a tablet and from a PC platform. It also comes with the possibility to make, edit and manage pictograms on a PC platform.\\
\\
In this report we also use some terms that often is misunderstood, as well as a few special words. We therefore want to clarify them here before we begin. The definitions can be seen in \autoref{tab:WordExplanation} and is from \citep{wikipedia}.
