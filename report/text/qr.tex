\section{QR Code Generation and Printing}
The multi-group last year decided that QR codes would be used as the only login method on tablets, which meant that the GIRAF administration system would need a system for generating and printing new QR codes, in the event a person lost their QR code. In collaboration with WASTELAND it was decided that it would be a security risk to allow people to print out existing QR codes, which meant that our system only has to facilitate the generation of new QR codes and the printing of those new QR codes. The last multi-group also decided that the QR codes would be based on a 512 character long string. The system generates the new QR codes using the code displayed in \autoref{lst:qrcode}. The QR code generation uses the function microtime in order to get data to hash. The function microtime relies on the system call gettimeofday, which means that this implementation will only work on UNIX based systems and Windows (PHP supplies its own implementation on Windows). The time from microtime is then hashed with the sha512 hashing function which generates a 128 hexadecimal long string. This is then repeated 3 more times in order to get a 512 hexadecimal long string, which is then the newly generated QR code.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{lstlisting}
function generateNewQr()
{
	$qr = "";
	for ($i=0; $i < 4; $i++) { 
		$time = microtime();
		$qr .= hash("sha512",$time);
		usleep(100); // sleep for 100 microseconds (0.1 milliseconds) to get a different time from microtime
	}
	return $qr;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The newly generated QR code is then inserted into the GIRAF database using the WASTELAND database API. Now the user is prompted to print out the new QR code, as this is the only chance the user has, without generating yet another new QR code. The PHP library phpqrcode\citep{phpqrcode} is used to generate the QR code itself into an image. In order to support the scalability of the QR code, the image is generated as an SVG, but because the original implementation of phpqrcode does not support SVG output, a modification of phpqrcode is used\citep{phpqrcodet0k4rt} which adds support for SVG and EPS. Due to a bug with Internet Explorer, phpqrcode was further modified so that the colour of the QR code is statically black. The bug with Internet Explorer was that phpqrcode would truncate the hex code of the colour black to #0 which in Internet Explorer would display as white, while in other browsers it would display as black. \\
After phpqrcode has generated the SVG, it is then added to a hidden iframe, which only contains the SVG and a separate CSS file which contains the style for printing the QR code. Javascript is then used to open the printing dialogue of the browser with the iframe as its focus, so that only the QR code is printed and not the whole page.
