\section{What is a multi-project?}
With the term multi-project we mean that multiple groups each work on their own sub-project which is a part of a larger project. In our case the larger project is Giraf and each group work on a separate part of the system.

Compared to working on a single project in isolation, working together creates new challenges. The software produced by each group has to be integrated to ensure the entire system works properly. Some projects are independent of the rest, while others rely heavily on some projects like the database. Groups have to work flexible and pass any requirements to other groups' projects early to prevent halts.

To ensure the project is successful and no misunderstandings occur, there must be good communication and cooperation between the groups. This requirement is amplified by the fact there are no definitive authoritative figures, other than those chosen by project members.
