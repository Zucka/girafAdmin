\subsection{Tortoise}
\label{sub:tortoise}
The Tortoise application focuses on helping children to learn about their own lives and strengthen their social skills. The hope is, that by letting the child interact with pictures and sentences, which are associated with their life, the child can develop an identity. By developing their own identity, the child will learn how to interact with other people by learning what kind of topics to talk about in a conversation with others.
