\section{Definition of a Multi-Project}
\label{sec:multiproject}
A multi-project is a project which includes multiple groups which each work on their own sub-project, which is part of a larger project. In this case, the larger project is the \ac{giraf} system and each group works on a separate part of the system.

Compared to working on a single project in isolation, working together creates new challenges. The software produced by each group has to be integrated to ensure the entire system works properly. Some projects are more independent on the rest, while others depends heavily on some projects like the database project Wasteland described in \secref{sub:wasteland}. Groups have to be flexible and pass any requirements to other groups' projects early to prevent halts.

To ensure the project is successful and no misunderstandings occur, there must be good communication and cooperation between the groups. This requirement is amplified by the fact that there are no definitive authoritative figures, other than those chosen by project members.
