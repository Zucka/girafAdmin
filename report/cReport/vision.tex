\section{Vision for \acs{giraf}}
The vision for \ac{giraf} is to create a multi-purpose application based on \emph{Android} which can simplify and ease the lives of autistic children and their guardians.

The purpose of \ac{giraf} is to replace physical items that are being used daily by the children and their guardians with digitized versions. The idea is to gather several functionalities in one object and allowing customization for each individual child.

This will also optimize work procedures on the individual institution in such a way, that guardians will save time doing repetitive tasks such as making pictograms. This time could be spent with the children instead.

As of spring of 2013 three schools and institutions for children with autism in Northern Jutland are involved in the development, but the hope is that \ac{giraf} will be distributed across all similar institutions in Denmark.
