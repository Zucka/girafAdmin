\subsection{Cars}
\label{sub:cars}
The aim of the Cars project is to develop an application, which will help children with infantile autism to be more comfortable in using their voice. To ensure that the children learn how to use their voice in creating different types of sounds, and not just speak in a monotone way, the application will require the children to create sounds covering different sides of the frequency spectrum.

Cars is a game in which the player has to lead a car through a street into a garage, controlling it with high or low frequency sounds. The car has a matching coloured garage at the end, which when entered completes the game successfully.
%The car and garages are colored and the two need to match to successfully complete the game. 
Randomly placed obstacles are used to force the player to avoid them to reach the end.
