\subsection{Admin}
\label{sec:admin}
This project focuses on the creation of an administration interface for the \ac{giraf} system. The Admin system consists of two parts, one for a desktop computer and one for \emph{Android}. The desktop part will run on a \ac{lamp} stack and communicate with the database using the database \ac{api} provided by the Wasteland (see \secref{sub:wasteland}) project. The \emph{Android} part will run on the tablet using the same code base as the desktop part, using a web server application. The main focus of the project is for department managers and guardians to be able to administrate the \ac{giraf} system.
