\subsection{Train}
\label{sub:train}
%Train is a game application for children with autism that is included as a part of the \ac{giraf} project.
The inspiration for Train comes from an exercise, which one of the guardians practices with the children. The purpose of the game is to create a dialogue between the child and the guardian. The child has to drag pictograms from a train station onto the train wagons and make the train drive. When the train arrives at the next station, the child has to drag the correct pictograms from the train and onto the station. The correct pictograms are decided by the station category.

The category for each station is chosen by the guardians by clicking the category picture frame and browsing \ac{cat} (\secref{subsub:cat}) for the picture they want to use. After selecting a category, they select which pictures they want associated with the station. %these are the pictograms the children will have to drag onto the specific station.
