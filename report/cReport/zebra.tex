\subsection{Zebra}
\label{sub:zebra}
The aim of the Zebra project is to create a software application aiding guardians in their work. The application should aid the guardian in situations where a child is to perform an ordered sequence of actions. These actions are typically represented by pictograms. %that the child understands\todo{kan der ikke findes et bedre ord?}.
Zebra should replace the current paper based version of this system. The guardian should be able to create and manage digital versions of such sequences specific to each child. Upon selecting a sequence for the child to follow, the child should be able to mark actions as done when they are completed to illustrate their progress.
