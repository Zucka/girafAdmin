\subsection{Parrot}
Parrot is an enhancement of the Parrot project of 2012 and is an application for communication between guardian and child. Its development is based around the currently used physical system \secref{subsub:pic_currentuse}. The original Parrot application from 2012 also included the administration of categories. It was therefore technically possible for a child using Parrot to access these administration tools, and it is for this reason, that the currently developed version has relocated the administration to a separate application named \acl{cat}. The version developed during this project will focus on making improvements to the \ac{gui} design, adding subcategories (such as breakfast item under the food category) and handle the interaction with pictograms. %in such a way, that a long-click is no longer necessary to drag a pictogram to the sentence board.
The primary focus for Parrot remains the same; providing an easier way for children to communicate with a guardian in a way that they are familiar with.

\subsubsection*{\acl{cat}}
\label{subsub:cat}
\ac{cat} focuses on administrating categories and subcategories. Currently \ac{cat} is also responsible for communicating with other applications that need specific pictograms, such as the Tortoise (\secref{sub:tortoise}) and Zebra (\secref{sub:zebra}) applications, by providing search/deliver functionality. %Furthermore \ac{cat} handles adding new pictures into categories and subcategories. 
%The primary focus for \ac{cat} is the search/deliver functionality and the administration of categories.
