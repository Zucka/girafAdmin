\subsection{The major story for 2013}
\begin{quote}
"The guardian arrives at the institution, and turns on the tablet.
The guardian knows that a new child is to arrive at the institution
after lunch. The guardian sets up and customizes a profile for the child,
this include creations of new pictograms.
The guardian also prepares games and a lifestory for the child.

After lunch the new child and the guardian meet, they immediately sit
down to do some communication practice using Parrot.

Afterwards the child wants to go outside to see the rest of the
institution, and needs to put on some outdoor clothes. The guardian
introduces the child to Zebra, and together they put on the child's
outdoor clothes.

When the child comes back in, the guardian and the child play the games
prepared earlier by the guardian.

When they are done playing the child and the guardian read the child's
lifestory using Tortoise."
